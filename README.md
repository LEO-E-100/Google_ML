<p>This is a side project of mine which uses Machine Learning algorithms from the Sci-kit learn library to predict Google Stock prices. Although the code can be used for any stock with quandl data.</p> 

<p>The algorithm is a simple linear regression and therefore does not represent a significantly useful algorithm. Linear regression on the lifetime of the Google stock is fairly easy as can be seen from the .png and other outputs of the code.</p>

<p>This was more an exercise in learning for me.</p> 

<p>Libraries used:
    <ul>
    <li>  Pandas
    <li>  Quandl
    <li>  Numpy
    <li>  Matplotlib
    <li>  Sci-kit Learn
    <li>  Datetime
    </ul>
</p>

<p>This is still a program being developed so errors are likely. </p>
