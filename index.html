<h1>Google Machine Learning</h1>

<p>This is a side project of mine which uses Machine Learning algorithms from the Sci-kit learn library to predict Google Stock prices. Although the code can be used for any stock with quandl data.</p>

<p>The algorithm is a simple linear regression and therefore does not represent a significantly useful algorithm. Linear regression on the lifetime of the Google stock is fairly easy as can be seen from the .png and other outputs of the code.</p>

<p>This was more an exercise in learning for me.</p>

<p>Libraries used:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Pandas</li>
    <li>Quandl</li>
    <li>Numpy</li>
    <li>Matplotlib</li>
    <li>Sci-kit Learn</li>
    <li>Datetime</li> 

<p>This is still a program being developed so errors are likely.</p>
